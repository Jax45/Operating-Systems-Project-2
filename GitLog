    I added an alarm to go off in the child process after 1 second and
    the appropriate message to be displayed if the subtask takes too long.
    also I added a similar alarm to the parent process that then kills the
    child process after the duration and closes the files.

    Initial commit. Options are working and the subset is printing to file correctly, lots of code is commented out and needs to be deleted.
